    <div class="Chick"><h5 id="Chicken">Chicken</h5>Chicken domestication likely occurred more than once in Southeast Asia and possibly India over the most recent 7,400 years, and the first domestications may have been for religious reasons or for the raising of fighting birds. Descendants of those domestications have spread throughout the world in several waves for at least the last 2,000 years. For most of that period, chickens were a common part of the livestock complement of farms and ranches throughout Eurasia and Africa. Only in the early 20th century, however, did chicken meat and eggs become mass-production commodities.

      Modern high-volume poultry farms, with rows of cages stacked indoors for control of heat, light, and humidity, began to proliferate in Great Britain about 1920 and in the United States after World War II. Females (mature hens and younger chickens, called pullets) are raised for meat and for their edible eggs. Farmers have developed numerous breeds and varieties to fulfill commercial requirements.

      Originally, meat production was a by-product of egg production. Only hens that could no longer produce enough eggs were killed and sold for meat. By the mid-20th century, however, meat production had outstripped egg production as a specialized industry. The market for chicken meat has grown dramatically since then, with worldwide exports reaching nearly 12.5 million metric tons (about 13.8 million tons) by the early 21st century.
      Mature males have long been used for sport (i.e., cockfighting, now outlawed in many jurisdictions) as well as for breeding. Many immature males (cockerels) are castrated (usually chemically, with hormones that cause atrophying of the testicles) to become meat birds (capons).

      <div class="Bee"><h5 id="Beef">Beef</h5>Cows are terrestrial ruminants that have inhabited this planet for millions of years. Modern-day cows are a result of thousands of years of evolution. The early-age cows were wild animals and very aggressive. Early-man domesticated cows for their purposes, as a result of which they have become the docile creatures that we see today. Cows are mammalian species and give birth to calves.
The conventional scientific name of cows is ‘Bos taurus.’ A large variety of cow breeds can be found in every part of the world. They have been the most significant source of food for man. In some countries, like India, cows are regarded as sacred animals. Moreover, eating their meat is a criminal offense. Countries like the USA freely eat cow meat in the form of beef. The most impressive physical attribute of cows is the presence of a four-chambered stomach. Their stomach acts as a fermentation container.
The cellulose is broken down and assimilated into their bloodstreams. The tough plant fibers that they graze on cannot be digested at a single go. This is why cows regurgitate their food from the stomach and chew on them again to facilitate digestion. The food coming out of their stomach for regurgitation is known as cud. This helps in more excellent absorption of nutrients.
The regurgitation process allows cows to eat a lot of food within a short time, as they can always bring them back to their mouths for chewing. India, Brazil, and China have the largest cow populations on earth. They are responsible for the 1/3rd population of cows on earth. Cows have supposedly domesticated nearly 10000 years ago from the wild species of ‘aurochs.’ The continent of Eurasia is the place where cows originated from. The popular cow species of India is B. Taurus indices. It had a hum-back form. We are hugely dependent on cows for many food products. Even the cow dung and cow urine are used by man. Cow urine is widely used in perfumes as a popular base.</div>
   
<div class="Sushi"><h5 id="Sush">Sushi</h5>The word "Sushi" comes from the Japanese word "Su" (酢) meaning vinegar, and "Meshi" (飯), meaning rice.
      Sushi is made with specially prepared rice, called sumeshi (酢飯). The rice is mixed with vinegar, salt, and sugar. Sushi is known for having raw or cooked seafood in it, but it sometimes has non-fish foods such as vegetables. Some sushi is wrapped in a sheet of seaweed called nori (海苔).
      Sushi is traditionally eaten by hand, but it is not wrong to eat it using chopsticks. Gari (Japanese pickled ginger slices) must be eaten with chopsticks.
      There are many different kinds of sushi. The most common sushi in Japan is nigirizushi (握り寿司): fish meat that is placed on top of a small portion of sumeshi. Sometimes you may find other ingredients on top of the sumeshi, such as roe (fish eggs), and sea urchin meat, instead of fish. Another type of sushi, makizushi (巻き寿司), consists of sumeshi rolled around fish and/or vegetables. In the US, makizushi is more popular than nigirizushi. Another type is known as temaki (手巻き) or a hand roll. This kind of sushi comes in a cone-shape, created by the nori wrapped around the ingredients inside. They are usually filled with a mixture of sumeshi, fish, and vegetables.
      Sushi is eaten with your bare hands or chopsticks. Soy sauce and wasabi are commonly eaten with sushi. Gari (sweet, pickled ginger) can often be found alongside a plate of sushi and also a little bit of wasabi, used as a palate cleanser. 
      In Japan, sushi is sometimes sold in "conveyor-belt shops" called kaiten zushi (回転寿司), where plates of sushi are put on a moving belt that passes by the customers. People freely take the sushi they want as it passes. The color of the plate shows the price of the sushi. This way of serving sushi is becoming more popular in other countries as well.</div>
